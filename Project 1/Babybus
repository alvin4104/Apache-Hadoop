The Babybus Project involves leveraging Hadoop to analyze and manage large-scale data related to products, customer interactions, and operational metrics for Babybus, a company specializing in educational toys and services. The objective is to uncover trends in sales, customer engagement, and operational efficiency to optimize business strategies.

Steps in the Project:
Data Ingestion:

Load raw data into Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) from various sources, including sales records, customer feedback, product inventory, and operational expenses.
Data includes fields such as product ID, product name, sales volume, regional performance, employee metrics, and customer satisfaction.
Data Storage and Management:

Use HDFS to store diverse datasets in a distributed and scalable manner.
Organize data by categories such as product details, sales transactions, operational costs, and customer interactions.
Schema Design with Apache Hive:

Create structured Hive tables to analyze data effectively.
Product Details: Product IDs, names, categories, and prices.
Sales Metrics: Sales quantities, revenue by region and time period.
Customer Engagement: Feedback, emails, names, and regional distribution.
Operational Metrics: Salaries, employee roles, and operational costs.
Data Processing:

Clean and preprocess data using HiveQL to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
Perform aggregations, filters, and joins to create meaningful datasets for analysis.
Analysis Goals:

Identify best-selling products and high-revenue regions.
Analyze seasonal sales trends and predict future demands.
Assess operational costs in relation to revenue generation.
Use customer feedback to improve product features and marketing strategies.
Visualization and Insights:

Create dashboards to visualize sales trends, regional performance, and customer satisfaction.
Showcase insights into cost optimization and market expansion opportunities.
Outcome:
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of Babybus’s business operations, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance product offerings, optimize costs, and improve customer satisfaction for sustained growth
